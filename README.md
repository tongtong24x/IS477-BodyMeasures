## Datasets
1. **Body Measurements Dataset (Mendeley Data)**  
   - Citation: Kiru, Muhammad (2021), “Body Measurements Datasets”, Mendeley Data, V1.  
   - DOI: [10.17632/bjv6c9pmp4.1](https://doi.org/10.17632/bjv6c9pmp4.1)  
   - Format: CSV  
   - Description: Contains anthropometric measurements such as height, weight, waist, chest, and calculated BMI values.  
   - Use: Provides an exploratory dataset for modeling, feature analysis, and understanding correlations among measurements.

2. **NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, CDC)**  
   - Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).  
   - Website: [NHANES Homepage](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?Cycle=2021-2023)  
   - Example Cycle: 2021–2023 Anthropometric Data  
   - Format: SAS Transport files (.XPT)  
   - Description: Nationally representative health survey including anthropometric measures (height, weight, BMI, waist circumference) and demographic variables (age, gender, race/ethnicity).  
   - Use: Serves as a large-scale, authoritative dataset to compare with the Mendeley Body Measurements dataset. Enables quality assessment, cross-population analysis, and reproducibility checks.

## Project Overview
This project is part of the IS477 course and aims to implement an **end-to-end data lifecycle workflow**.  
We will integrate and analyze two anthropometric datasets to explore:
- Differences in body measurements across populations and survey methods.
- Data quality issues and reproducibility.
- Ethical and legal considerations of data use.

## Planned Deliverables
- **Project Plan** (`ProjectPlan.md`)  
- **Status Report** (`StatusReport.md`)  
- **Final Report** (`README.md`) with:
  - Data profile
  - Data quality assessment
  - Findings and visualizations
  - Workflow reproducibility instructions
